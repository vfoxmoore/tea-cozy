Pull Requests
The idea is to create a repo with an empty main branch. Then add all your code on a new branch. Then create a pull request so that your entire project is part of the pull request.

make a new folder for the project (windows explorer)
open it in vscode
initialize a git repo (source control tab or use the command line: git init)
make a readme and add it to an initial commit, and publish branch
create a new branch to work from (git checkout -b branch-name)
code up your project, commit as you go
publish new branch
make a pull request
